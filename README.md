# Hangman
Java Hangman console window game created by me on 1/30/2021 in Eclipse IDE.

Gameword.java class file that has 200 "difficult" hangman words and method to randomly pick one.

Classic dashed line representation of mystery word ( _ _ _ _ _ ) updated as you go.

A "Letter's guessed" section above the word showing letters guessed so far.
